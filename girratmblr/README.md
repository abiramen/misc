# Girraween Timetablr
_a tool to help students get hyped for their next lesson with a fun countdown_

I made girratmblr in mid-2018 as a fun project which provided students at my high school with countdowns to school bells, with integrated timetable support through importing from iCal files, Firebase storage and school announcements and calendars.

Unfortunately, my high school completely changed their timetable structure in 2020, right after I graduated. This project was never updated, so this is all that remains.
